# Trust Work

**Trust Work** is a decentralized platform designed to create **fair, transparent, and trust-based work agreements** between individuals and businesses. It solves the issue of informal or exploitative work arrangements by introducing **verifiable agreements**, **automated payment handling**, and **dispute resolution**—all powered by blockchain and smart contracts.

## 🚀 Features

- **Trust Contracts**: Digital agreements that define the scope of work, payment terms, and deadlines.
- **Secure Payments**: Funds are held in escrow until the work is completed and verified.
- **Dispute Resolution**: Neutral mediators or automated rules handle disagreements fairly.
- **Transparency & Accountability**: Every agreement and transaction is logged, ensuring trust without middlemen.
- **Reputation System**: Workers and employers build credibility through successful, fair interactions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TailwindCSS for a clean, responsive interface
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for APIs
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for structured data storage
- **Authentication**: JWT-based secure login system
